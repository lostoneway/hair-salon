# Loc'd and Lovin' It!

[Check It Out!](https://locdandlovingit.netlify.app/)

This is a landing page for a natural hair salon. I really enjoyed building this to allowing me to flex my HTML and CSS muscles. 

## Problems 
- `background-attachment: fixed;`  does not play nice with Safari. Any background image scrolling would break or image would not appear. I decided I didn't need it. 


## What are some goals for this web app?
- Gain a better understanding of HTML and CSS. 
- Experiment with media queries by starting with a simple mobile first approach.
- Have clean code, sematic HTML and dry (as I can get it!) CSS. 



## Ways to tackle the project
- Draft the HTML before styling. To get a sense of the flow of the document. 
- Utilize [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) for great, free to use photos! 
- Practice CSS Grid, it'll be a one of the focal pieces of the site.
